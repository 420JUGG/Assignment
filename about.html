    <h2> Welcome to my portfolio website, i am the jugg king a front-end developer.</h2>
    <p> Jugg is what you would call a baby front-end developer because he's still trying to figure out his path in web development, <br>
       he's driven by the thirst of knowledge and money and he considers himself a "forever student" because as lao zi said "To know is to not know", <br>
       he has not really accomplished a lot on this path because he's new to it, in a few years however he would have made substansial contributions to the development of the internet and his career, <br>
       Jugg believes mindfulness and consistency is the key to success and currently he meditates and reads lots of books.
